# ML/Deep Learning for Socioeconomic Indicator Prediction

 ![Alt text](https://github.com/YonSci/UNECA-Deep-Learning-for-Socioeconomic-Indicator-Prediction/blob/main/Images/intro_im.png)   

The primary aim of this project is to integrate **survey data** and **high-resolution satellite imagery**, leveraging **machine learning/Deep Learning** methodologies to forecast **socioeconomic indicators**. 
The project is specifically centered around the theme "**Application of Deep Learning to Predict Socioeconomic Indicators using Survey Data and High-resolution Satellite Imagery."** 

Case Study: **"Consumption Expenditure Prediction in Malawi."**

Using such an approach demands a substantial grasp of machine learning and Deep Learning concepts, coupled with a considerable investment of time in data preparation and model training. 

To streamline this complex process, we documented each step, explaining each line of code, adopting the contemporary methodology established by researchers at [Stanford University.]( https://sustain.stanford.edu/predicting-poverty)

Our overarching goal is to create a reproducible framework utilizing open-source tools and resources. This framework is designed to empower National Statistics Offices (NSOs) across Africa, providing them with the means to implement similar methodologies.

The documentation includes important stages such as:
1) **Survey data collection, and processing**
2) **Nightlight satellite imagery acquisition, and processing**
3) **Sampling method to generate download locations and undersampling to avoid bias**
4) **Create nightlight bins/labels**
5) **Daytime satellite imagery acquisition and processing**
6) **Preparation of training and validation datasets**
7) **Train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and their variants (VGG) using a transfer learning approach**
8) **Feature extraction and aggregation**
9) **Building prediction model: Ridge regression model**

The implementation is facilitated through the 
- **Python programming language**
- **Google Earth Engine**
- **PyTorch framework**

This endeavor aims not only to advance our understanding of the subject matter but also to foster knowledge-sharing and collaboration within the data science community.

## Model Output 
The [model output](https://github.com/YonSci/UNECA-Deep-Learning-for-Socioeconomic-Indicator-Prediction/tree/main/Model_Out) directory contains the aggregated extracted feature vectors and cluster order files:

  ### Aggregated extracted feature vectors: 
    - used as input to predict consumption at a cluster level.
    
  ### Cluster order: 
    - the order of the clusters during the feature extraction.
