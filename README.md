# UNECA-Deep-Learning-for-Socioeconomic-Indicator-Prediction

The primary aim of this project is to integrate survey data and high-resolution satellite imagery, leveraging machine learning and Deep Learning methodologies to forecast socioeconomic indicators. 
The project is specifically centered around the theme "**Application of Deep Learning to Predict Socioeconomic Indicators using Survey Data and High-resolution Satellite Imagery**, Case Study: **Consumption Expenditure Prediction in Malawi."**

Executing such an approach demands a substantial grasp of machine learning and Deep Learning concepts, coupled with a considerable investment of time in data preparation and model training. 
To streamline this complex process, we meticulously documented each step, adhering to the methodology established by researchers at Stanford University. 
Our overarching goal is to create a reproducible framework utilizing open-source tools and resources. This framework is designed to empower National Statistics Offices (NSOs) across Africa, providing them with the means to implement similar methodologies.

The comprehensive documentation encompasses pivotal stages such as survey data collection, Nightlight satellite imagery acquisition, Daytime satellite imagery utilization, data processing, data cleaning, and visualization, as well as the preparation of training and validation datasets. Furthermore, the guide delves into intricate aspects including training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, feature extraction, and the prediction phase, all meticulously explained line by line. The implementation is facilitated through the Python programming language and the PyTorch framework. This endeavor aims not only to advance our understanding of the subject matter but also to foster knowledge-sharing and collaboration within the data science community.
